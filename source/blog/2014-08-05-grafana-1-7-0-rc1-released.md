## Grafana & full time development

The future for Grafana looks very bright. I am, since last week, working on it full time. I currently have no sponsor
or income besides my company (Coding Instinct AB) savings. So any company that wants to sponsor development, can get
their logo on the start page, mentions in release notes and emails. Please email me at [torkel@grafana.org](mailto:contact@grafana.org)

Another avenue that I am going to explore, if sponsoring does not pan out,
is working on a paid premium version and a hosted version. There is so much more that can
be done with Grafana in turns of future features, improvements and polish. There is also a a lot of time consuming
maintainaince (library upgrades), support and documentation that needs to be done. So full time development is
really needed. The question is how to finance it.

## Meetups, Conferences & Company talks/coaching

If you want me to come talk about Grafana, application metrics, build measure learn or Graphite.
Please email me at [torkel@grafana.org](mailto:contact@grafana.org). I live in Stockholm Sweden so
travel could be an issue, but I am flexible and available :)

Cheers & keep on graphing!<br>
Torkel
