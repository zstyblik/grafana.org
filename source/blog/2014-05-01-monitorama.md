On Saturday I am flying to Portland for what I am hoping to be a great conference, [Monitorama PDX](http://monitorama.com/). The last day of the
conference is full hackathon day with workshops and lightning talks. I will present a workshop on Grafana that I hope to fill with some project
background, demos, tips and ticks, interesting ways to use graphite, questions and answers.

I was added kind of late to the speaker line up so it has
been a busy week trying to get a publicly accessable demo and playground ready so everyone can try and play with Grafana.

After Portland I will fly to San Fransciso for a short 2 day visit. Incredibly excited for the coming week!.

I will bring many Grafana stickers and a few tshirts so be sure to seek my out or attend the workshop!
