You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.</p><p>For some background on why contributor license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other open source projects:</p><ul><li><a target="blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/faq/">Django's excellent CLA FAQ</a></li><li><a target="blank" href="http://producingoss.com/en/copyright-assignment.html">A well-written chapter from Karl Fogel's Producing Open Source Software on CLAs</a></li><li><a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_license_agreement">The Wikipedia article on CLAs</a></li></ul><p>This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.</p><p>If you have more questions, shoot us an email or drop by #influxdb on IRC.</p><p><i>Many thanks to <a target="blank" href="http://rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a> for permission to re-use their CLA!</i></p><hr /><h2>Terms of the Agreement</h2><p>This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Errplane, Inc. dba InfluxDB, a Delaware corporation (“InfluxDB,” “we” or “us” etc.) and you (as defined and further identified below).

Rights.</strong> Except as set out above, you keep all right, title, and interest in your contribution. The rights that you grant to us under this agreement are effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to us, even if your submission took place before the date you entered this agreement.</p><p><strong>5. You represent and warrant that:</strong></p><p><strong>(i)</strong> the contributions are an original work and that you can legally grant the rights set out in this agreement;</p><p><strong>(ii)</strong> the contributions and InfluxDB’s exercise of any license rights granted hereunder, does not and will not, infringe the rights of any third party;</p><p><strong>(iii)</strong> you are not aware of any pending or threatened claims, suits, actions, or charges pertaining to the contributions, including without limitation any claims or allegations that any or all of the contributions infringes, violates, or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party (you further agree that you will notify InfluxDB immediately if you become aware of any such actual or potential claims, suits, actions, allegations or charges).</p><p><strong>6.

This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California in the United States without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.</p><iframe frameborder="0" height="820" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cii_G2M-c1h-MSY1qyGOFoo5EZjZGuUK4B9fMUSF8o4/viewform?embedded=true" width="800">Loading CLA...</iframe></div></div></section><div id="blueimp-gallery" class="blueimp-gallery blueimp-gallery-controls"><div class="slides"></div><h3 class="title"></h3><a class="prev">‹</a><a class="next">›</a><a class="close">×</a><a class="play-pause"></a><ol class="indicator"></ol></div><footer class="page-footer"><div class="footer-bg"></div><div class="footer-content row text-center"><section class="newsletter"><div class="row"><h3 class="text-center">Get notified of new releases</h3></div><div class="row"><div class="medium-10 large-6 columns medium-offset-1 large-offset-3"><form action="http://grafana.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2aeb5711db2aececc990be536&amp;id=5585d37ecc" class="validate" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="row collapse"><div class="medium-10 columns"><input class="email" id="mce-EMAIL" name="EMAIL" placeholder="email address" type="email" value="" /></div><div class="medium-2 columns"><input class="button postfix" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" name="subscribe" type="submit" value="Subscribe" /></div></div></form></div></div></section><div class="footer-social"><span><i class="fa fa-github"></i><a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues">issue tracker</a> on GitHub</span><span><i class="fa fa-comment"></i><a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#grafana">#grafana</a> on freenode</span><span><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i><a href="http://twitter.com/grafana">@grafana</a> on Twitter</span><span><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i><a href="mailto:torkel@grafana.org">email</a></span></div><div class="row copyright text-center">&copy; 2015 Torkel Ödegaard &amp; Coding Instinct AB</div></div></footer><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
